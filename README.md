# 🖴 PiPDA - A Retro Python PDA Interface

**PiPDA** is a stylized, personal digital assistant (PDA) interface built with Python and PySide6, themed to look and feel like a classic 90s PDA. It features built-in tools, app installation, and an extension system to easily build and add new functionality.

<span style="color:red;">PiPDA is currently in beta, meaning that no binaries will be released and the code is very likely to be bugged and not working. Use at your own risk.</span>
