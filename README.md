# 🖴 PiPDA - A Retro Python PDA Interface

**PiPDA** is a stylized, personal digital assistant (PDA) interface built with Python and PySide6, themed to look and feel like a classic 90s Palm device. It features built-in tools, app installation, and an extension system to easily build and add new functionality.

Designed for devices like the Raspberry Pi 400, but runs great on desktops too!
